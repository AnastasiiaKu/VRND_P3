Udacity - Maze Project - Anastasiia Kucherenko

# Time spent on the project, what I enjoyed and what found challenging

Very many hours of quite a few days. I don't know what was I doing wrong, and if I accidentaly clicked something, but sometimes when running the maze scene everything would go correctly, and the next time I revisit it, not chaning any code, it wouldn't. 

Also, I looked through and tried to apply codes of other people I found on forums and despite they would say code worked, it wouldn't work on my computer. So, in the end I came back to my solution, as I guess, I was doing something wrong in the Inspector rather than having mistakes with the code?

This has been the most challenging chapter for me so far. But I am still enjoying it :)
